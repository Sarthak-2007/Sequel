    # This will run unit tests. UI tests (androidTest) require an emulator or device.
    # For a CI environment, running UI tests typically involves setting up an emulator.
    # I will include the unit test step as specified.
    # If UI tests are also expected to run here, the workflow will need an emulator setup step.
